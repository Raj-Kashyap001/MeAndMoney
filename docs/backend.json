    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to ensure security, scalability, and ease of debugging, adhering to the core design principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and QAPs (Rules are not Filters). It leverages Structural Segregation, Access Modeling, and Data Clarity for optimal performance and maintainability.\n\nAuthorization Independence (CRITICAL):  The structure avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies (`get()`).  All authorization data is co-located to a document or denormalized into subcollections. For instance, access to Accounts, Transactions, and Categories is determined solely by the `userId` present in the document itself, not by querying any parent document.  The path-based ownership (e.g., `/users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId}`) inherently ensures that rules can validate `request.auth.uid == userId` without needing to `get()` the user document.  Denormalization isn't explicitly needed here because the paths themselves provide sufficient authorization context.\n\nClarity of Intent (Debuggability): The structure makes the authorization intent explicit through the use of clear, semantic naming conventions and path-based ownership. Each collection's purpose is evident from its name (e.g., `/users/{userId}/accounts` clearly indicates user-owned accounts).\n\nDBAC (No Custom Claims):  The structure relies solely on `request.auth.uid` for authorization, avoiding custom claims. Roles are implicitly derived from ownership of the documents, which the path structure provides.\n\nQAPs (Rules are not Filters): The structure is designed to facilitate secure `list` operations. Because each collection is segregated by user, listing accounts (`/users/{userId}/accounts`) only returns accounts belonging to the authenticated user. The rules only need to verify that `request.auth.uid == userId` to ensure that a user can only access their own accounts. Similar patterns apply to categories and transactions.  No filtering is required in the rules themselves.\n\nInvariants: The structure supports the integrity of ownership, timestamps, and denormalized data. Ownership is enforced through path-based access control. Timestamps are not explicitly modeled in schemas provided, but the structure naturally supports the addition of server timestamps.\n\n**Structural Segregation:**  All documents within a collection share the same security requirements. For example, all documents within `/users/{userId}/accounts` are owned by the user specified in the path.\n\n**Access Modeling:**\n*   Private Data: Path-Based ownership (`/users/{userId}/accounts`).\n*   Use Hierarchical Paths for User-Owned Data: For entities that represent a `User 1:N Entity` relationship (e.g., a `User` has many `Accounts`), prefer path-based ownership like `/users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId}`.\n*   Continue Hierarchy for Nested Data: For entities with nested `1:N` references (e.g., an `Account` has many `Transactions`), continue the path structure: `/users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId}/transactions/{transactionId}`."
